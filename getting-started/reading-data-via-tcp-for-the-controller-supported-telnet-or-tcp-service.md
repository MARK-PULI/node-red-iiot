# Reading data via TCP for the controller supported Telnet or TCP Service

#### Requirements

* The documents of TCP service commands from the controller, and the IP address of the controller.
* If the flow is installed in Raspberry Pi, one of the Rasp ports must have the same segment as the controller. You can select the Lan port or Wifi port.

#### The example flow(the NDC measurement system for the online basic weight  measurement system which supported TCP service, and the Node-RED flow installed in Raspberry Pi)
