I-IoT with Node-RED Platform
This document introduces how to use the Node-RED platform, build the  I-IoT applications for your company in a private cloud. 
The key IoT technologies in this document are 

1. NAS(Network Attached Storage) as the Node-RED server, MQTT server(Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), 
 and DB server(we install MongoDB). Raspberry pi installs Node-RED as the gateway and for edge computing.
2. Advantec WISE-4000 as the IoT sensing device for AI/DI or Modbus devices. 
3. The main functions of the I-IoT platform.
4. System maintenance.

Here we only focus on the concept of designing the I-IoT platform, and not on coding. 
You can get many information and examples on the internet by using the search engine.
